# Masters-Coursework
Coursework and projects from CS Master

This repository contains assignments and final projects related to some of the coursework I completed during my Master's program. There may be some missing details related to deadlines, assignment submission processes, or storage in the relevant files. The homework (HW) assignments were completed according to the given instructions. However the surveys and projects were individually chosen.

## Parallel Computing:
All assignments implemented from scratch without using any libraries. \
Code and performance profiling were included.
        
- **Hw1**: *(CPU, MPI)*: Parallel Summation implementation using MPI in C.
        
- **Hw2**: *(CPU, MPI)*: Parallel and Serial Quicksort Implementation using MPI in C.
> In the parallel implementation, a hypercube topology was utilized for processor distribution in the Message Passing Interface (MPI) model. The E-Cube routing method was implemented for communication between processing nodes.

- **Hw3**: *(CPU, OpenMP)*: Parallel Image Processing using OpenMP in C/C++.
> Blurring, Denoising, and Edge-Extension.

- **Hw4**: *(GPU, CUDA)*: Parallel Image Processing using CUDA (nvcc) in C. 
> Blurring, Denoising, and Edge-Extension executed on Google Colab NVIDIA GPU.
        
## Neural Networks:
All assignments implemented from scratch without using any libraries. \
Reports and code (python, jupyter notebook) provided.
        
- **Hw1**: Vanilla Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition.
> Trained on the MNIST dataset.
        
- **Hw2**: Recurrent Neural Network for Human Activity Recognition.
> Input consists of three time-domain signals, classified into six categories.
        
- **Hw3**: Neural Network for Human Activity Recognition.
> Input consists of three statistical features, classified into six categories.\
> Trained on the Samsung Galaxy S II dataset.

#### Final Project (Individual Study)
Development and Training of a ResNet-like Residual Model in *PyTorch* for Achieving State-of-the-Art Image Classification Performance on the CIFAR-10 Dataset.
        
## Machine Learning
All assignments implemented from scratch without using any libraries. \
